ðŸ§  Intelligent Multi-Platform Chatbot (AI-Powered)

I developed an intelligent chatbot powered by artificial intelligence that can receive and answer customer inquiries through multiple social media platforms â€” such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram, Eitaa, Bale, and also via webhooks connected to online chat systems (like Goftino or similar).

The chatbot is integrated with WooCommerce, allowing it to handle real e-commerce requests, product inquiries, and order tracking automatically.

To provide more accurate responses, the chatbot first categorizes incoming questions and uses a dedicated AI model for each category, including:

Product recommendations

Order status inquiries

Frequently asked questions (shipping, packaging, cost, delivery time, etc.)

Wholesale and B2B inquiries

Miscellaneous questions

The system is trained and supervised by the user, and it politely refuses to answer untrained or unrelated questions â€” this helps reduce unnecessary AI token usage.

The chatbot is also context-aware and platform-focused: if a question arrives from WhatsApp, it automatically replies through the same channel.

Additional features and integrations can be customized based on client needs.
